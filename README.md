# Electron + Create-React-App

## Carbon Design Process

Following along the official [IBM Tutorial](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview). Start the React app (preparing the SASS styles takes a long time!):


```bash
npm install
npm start
```


To start the Electron App - first stop the React app then run:


```bash
npm run dev
```


 Preparing the SASS styles takes a long time! Don't panic. Get yourself a coffee!
